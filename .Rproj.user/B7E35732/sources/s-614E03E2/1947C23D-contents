This is a _sample_ book written in **Markdown**. You can use anything that Pandoc's Markdown supports, e.g., a math equation $a^2 + b^2 = c^2$.

The **bookdown** package can be installed from CRAN or Github:
nothing

```{r eval=FALSE}
install.packages("bookdown")
# or the development version
# devtools::install_github("rstudio/bookdown")
```

If you want to generate PDF output, you will need to install LaTeX. For R Markdown users who have not installed LaTeX before, we recommend that you install TinyTeX (https://yihui.name/tinytex/):

```{r eval=FALSE}
install.packages('tinytex')
tinytex::install_tinytex()  # install TinyTeX
Remember each Rmd file contains one and only one chapter, and a chapter is defined by the first-level heading `#`.
```
