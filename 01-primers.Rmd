## Exercises

### Overview 

- **Input**: Reads for the first time the dataset 1 of two (Swiss) FLUXNET sites at high temporal resolution with 3-4 measures. 
- **Output**: Learned about the data structure and the capacity to explore the content of the dataframe and visualize it so that it can be analysed in the next session.
- **Data**: Dataset 1 First hands-on with one of two (Swiss) FLUXNET sites at high temporal resolution with 3-4 measureswith high-resolution fluxnet dataset

**Contents**

- Content and operations:
- Managing the workspace and data
- Basic operations in R
- RStudio, debugging
- Reading a table into a data frame
- Objects, data frames, lists
- Applying a function, loop, etc.
- Simple plotting
- Making workflow reproducible
	- RMarkdown
- Coding
	- Best practices
	- Modularity
- Version control with git (for dummies: GitHub, fork, clone, commit, push, pull, branch)


### Reading data into R

Load libraries.
```{r}
library(readr)
library(tidyverse)
```

Read data from Laegern site.
```{r}
df_fluxes <- read_csv("./data/FLX_CH-Lae_FLUXNET2015_FULLSET_HH_2004-2014_1-3.csv", ) 
```

Plot something.
```{r}
ggplot(data = slice(df_fluxes, 1:1000), aes(x = TIMESTAMP_START, NEE_VUT_REF)) +
  geom_line()
```


## How to use Bookdown and Markdown

This is a _sample_ book written in **Markdown**. You can use anything that Pandoc's Markdown supports, e.g., a math equation $a^2 + b^2 = c^2$.

The **bookdown** package can be installed from CRAN or Github:
nothing

```{r eval=FALSE}
install.packages("bookdown")
# or the development version
# devtools::install_github("rstudio/bookdown")
```

If you want to generate PDF output, you will need to install LaTeX. For R Markdown users who have not installed LaTeX before, we recommend that you install TinyTeX (https://yihui.name/tinytex/):

```{r eval=FALSE}
install.packages('tinytex')
tinytex::install_tinytex()  # install TinyTeX
Remember each Rmd file contains one and only one chapter, and a chapter is defined by the first-level heading `#`.
```
